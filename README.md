# Dataset Description (for reference)

This scene was gathered by AVIRIS sensor over the Indian Pines test site in North-western Indiana and consists of 145\times145 pixels and 224 spectral reflectance bands in the wavelength range 0.4â€“2.5 10^(-6) meters. This scene is a subset of a larger one. The Indian Pines scene contains two-thirds agriculture, and one-third forest or other natural perennial vegetation. There are two major dual lane highways, a rail line, as well as some low density housing, other built structures, and smaller roads. Since the scene is taken in June some of the crops present, corn, soybeans, are in early stages of growth with less than 5% coverage. The ground truth available is designated into sixteen classes and is not all mutually exclusive. We have also reduced the number of bands to 200 by removing bands covering the region of water absorption: [104-108], [150-163], 220. Indian Pines data are available through Pursue's univeristy MultiSpec site.
